Chatter is a Twitter-like demo for "Scala":http://www.scala-lang.org and "Lift":http://liftweb.net.

While offering all the core features like registration and login, following people and - of course - sending messages to followers the amount of code is astonishing small. This comes from Scala's conciseness and Lift's powerful features like ready-to-use user management and superb Comet support.

Take a look at the "source code":http://github.com/weiglewilczek/chatter or start chattering at our "live site":http://weiglewilczek.com/labs/chatter.
